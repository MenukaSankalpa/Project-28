An Age Calculator web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript lets users input their birthdate to calculate their exact age in years, months, and days. The interface includes a date picker and a "Calculate" button. JavaScript processes the input, determines the age, and displays the result dynamically. CSS ensures a clean, user-friendly design.
